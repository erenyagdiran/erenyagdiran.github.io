      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am quite excited about my new blog here.I am planning to write one blog post every day.
Since the title is reversing part 1 , i would like to tell you my story about a job interview that was held in Ankara,TR.
I applied a position named as &amp;quot;Software Security Engineer&amp;quot; and when i got the company , they asked me really low level stuff some of them i know , some of them i dont.
Then they send me an email which includes an attachment for a protected and encrypted binary.
When i got home , i downloaded it and it asked me only a password to unlock it.They wanted me to find that password :) First of all , it looks pretty hard but i will try to introduce the general concept that i had followed :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the first thing i typed in the terminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;root@lisa:~# ./CrackTheDoor 

        *** DOOR CONTROL SYSTEM  ***



PASSWORD:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
